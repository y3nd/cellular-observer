# Observer `_sys` CLI command reference

The Offband observer is configured over the **`_sys` system channel** in the
MeshCore companion app (BLE), or through the USB serial text console on builds
that expose it. Both paths use the same allowlist and command dispatcher.

## Grammar (#45)

Two shapes, consistently:

- **status / actions** — namespace-subcommand `<ns> <verb>`:
  `wifi status`, `mqtt status`, `mqtt enable 0`, `wifi disable`
- **single fields** — verb-first dotted `get|set <ns>.<field>`:
  `set wifi.ssid Home`, `get mqtt.broker.0.url`

The verb + field are case-insensitive (phone auto-capitalize is tolerated, so
`Wifi status` works). Secrets (`wifi.pwd`, `mqtt.broker.N.password`) are
**write-only** — never echoed back.

Commands reach the dispatcher through a `_sys` allowlist that permits the
`get`, `set`, `mqtt`, `wifi`, `display`, `ble`, and `caplog` verbs and rejects shell
metacharacters (`$(`, backtick, `!`) plus device/filesystem verbs
(`reboot`/`format`/`erase`/`factory`/`ota.`/`fs.`/`flash.`/`rm`/`cat`/`exit`/`quit`).

## WiFi

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `wifi status` | STA state + IP when connected |
| `set wifi.ssid <ssid>` | set STA SSID |
| `set wifi.pwd <psk>` | set STA password (reboot / STA-retry to apply) |
| `get wifi.ssid` | read configured SSID |
| `wifi enable` / `wifi disable` | STA on/off policy flag — **reboot to apply** |

> `get wifi.status` still works as a backward-compat alias for `wifi status`.
> `wifi disable` is deliberately reboot-to-apply: it does **not** drop a live
> STA, because the `_sys` channel and the MQTT uplink ride that link.

## Display

Device-local display controls (no network needed). Persisted in NVS (the
fork-branded `offband_ui` namespace) and applied **live** — no reboot. On builds
with a display (Heltec V3 / V4 OLED, V4 TFT).

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `display always on` | keep the screen lit — don't auto-blank after 15 s |
| `display normal` | restore the default 15 s auto-blank (`display always off` is an accepted alias) |
| `display rotate 0` / `display rotate 180` | screen orientation — `180` for upside-down mounting |
| `display flip` | toggle rotation 0 ↔ 180 (the reply reports the resulting state) |

> Rotation is **0/180 only** (landscape flip); 90/270 portrait is not supported.
> Both settings default off / 0 and survive a reboot.

## Bluetooth

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ble status` | show the persisted BLE availability setting |
| `ble on` / `ble enable` | enable BLE advertising immediately and persist it across reboots |
| `ble off` / `ble disable` | stop BLE advertising, disconnect its client, and persist it across reboots |

BLE defaults on for backward compatibility. When persisted off, the next boot
initializes the stack but does not register or advertise the BLE transport;
USB serial can turn it back on without rebooting.

## MQTT broker pool

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `mqtt status` | pool summary + per-slot live state (**configured slots only**) |
| `mqtt view <N>` | full stored config for slot N, configured or empty (secrets redacted) |
| `mqtt enable <N>` / `mqtt disable <N>` | enable/disable broker slot N |
| `mqtt clear <N>` | wipe slot N's stored config back to empty |
| `set mqtt.broker.<N>.<key> <value>` | set a broker field |
| `get mqtt.broker.<N>.<key>` | read a broker field (secrets redacted) |
| `set mqtt.iata <code>` | global IATA / location code |
| `set mqtt.status_interval <10..3600>` | status publish cadence (seconds) |

Broker fields (`<key>`): `url`, `port`, `transport` (tcp\|tls\|wss),
`auth_type` (none\|basic\|jwt), `username`, `password` (write-only),
`topic_prefix`, `iata_override`, `ca_cert`, `jwt_audience`, `jwt_refresh`,
`jwt_owner`, `jwt_email`.

`enabled` is **read-only** (via `get`) — there is no `set …enabled`; toggle a
slot with `mqtt enable <N>` / `mqtt disable <N>`.

**Field constraints:** `port` `1..65535` (per-transport defaults
`1883`/`8883`/`9001` for tcp/tls/wss); `jwt_owner` = exactly **64 hex chars**;
`jwt_refresh` `60..86400` s; `status_interval` `10..3600` s (**default 30**).

**Recovery:** `set web.allow_initial <on|off>` is a recovery override for the web
UI's initial-password gate (writes NVS `web/allow_initial`); leave `off` in
normal operation.

Setting a field on a **live** (enabled) broker slot auto-disables that slot;
re-enable explicitly with `mqtt enable <N>` once the config is complete.

`mqtt clear <N>` wipes a slot's stored config back to empty (URL + every field
blank, disabled) — it clears the *fields*, not the device. A **default** slot
(0–5) is re-seeded to its default on the next reboot (the boot seed fills empty
slots — this is the recovery path); a **custom** slot (6–9) stays empty until
you reconfigure it. Handy for migrating a slot to the current seed: `mqtt clear
3` then reboot re-seeds slot 3 to the new default (MeshMapper).

**`mqtt status` lists only *configured* slots** — a slot appears only once it
has a URL. An empty / unconfigured slot is **not** shown, so the highest number
you see is your last configured slot, not the slot ceiling (currently 10, slots
0–9). To inspect a specific slot regardless of whether it's configured, use
`mqtt view <N>`: an empty slot reads `url=(unset)`.

`mqtt view <N>` (#98) dumps every stored field for one slot in a few packed
lines, in the familiar order: `url, port, transport, auth_type, username,
jwt_audience, jwt_owner, jwt_email, jwt_refresh, ca_cert, iata`. Secrets are
never echoed — a basic-auth `password` shows `(set)` / `(unset)`, and the JWT
bearer token (auto-minted at connect) is omitted entirely. A JWT slot's
`username` and `jwt_owner` show their auto-derived defaults when unset
(`auto(v1_+pubkey)` and `auto(device-pubkey)` — the device's own pubkey, #95).
Live state (up / backoff / retries) stays in `mqtt status`; `view` is the
stored **config**.

## Broker auth — wss/jwt (the real recipe)

The public MeshCore brokers (LetsMesh, CoreComms.net) use `wss` + JWT. The credential
is your node's **own Ed25519 public key** — the firmware mints the token; there's
no separate registration. Configure a wss/jwt slot like this:

```
set mqtt.broker.1.url           wss://mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net:443/mqtt
set mqtt.broker.1.transport     wss
set mqtt.broker.1.auth_type     jwt
set mqtt.broker.1.ca_cert       gts-r4
set mqtt.broker.1.jwt_audience  mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net
set mqtt.broker.1.username      <your node pubkey>
set mqtt.broker.1.jwt_owner     <your node pubkey>
set mqtt.broker.1.jwt_email     you@example.com
mqtt enable 1
mqtt status
```

- **`username` + `jwt_owner` = your node's pubkey.** The firmware mints the JWT
  (the password — you do **not** set it) and normalizes `jwt_owner` case
  internally, so the input case doesn't matter.
- **The exact `username` form is broker-dependent.** A **bare pubkey** works on
  CoreComms.net; some brokers expect a `v1_<pubkey>` prefix. If a wss slot won't
  authenticate, try the other form. (Defaulting this per broker is #95.)

### Seeded broker slots (#317, #592)

| Slot | Broker | url | ca_cert | jwt_audience |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | OKIMesh mqtt1 | `wss://mqtt1.okimesh.org:9002/mqtt` | `letsencrypt` | — (anon) |
| 1 | OKIMesh mqtt2 | `wss://mqtt2.okimesh.org:9002/mqtt` | `letsencrypt` | — (anon) |
| 2 | MeshMapper | `wss://mqtt.meshmapper.net:443/mqtt` | `isrg-x2` | `mqtt.meshmapper.net` |
| 3 | CoreComms.net | `wss://mqtt.corecomms.net:443/mqtt` | `gts-r4` | `mqtt.corecomms.net` |
| 4 | Eastmesh.au | `wss://mqtt2.eastmesh.au:443/mqtt` | `gts-r4` | `mqtt2.eastmesh.au` |
| 5–9 | *(empty)* | — | — | — |

**Every seeded slot ships disabled** (#262) — `mqtt enable <N>` to opt in.

**LetsMesh is no longer seeded** (#317). To add it by hand in a free slot:

| Broker | url | ca_cert | jwt_audience |
|---|---|---|---|
| LetsMesh-US | `wss://mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net:443/mqtt` | `gts-r4` | `mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net` (bare) |
| LetsMesh-EU | `wss://mqtt-eu-v1.letsmesh.net:443/mqtt` | `gts-r4` | `mqtt-eu-v1.letsmesh.net` (bare) |

> **Devices flashed before #317 keep their old layout.** Seeding is
> skip-if-present, so a reorder never reshuffles a device that was already
> seeded — run `mqtt view <N>` to see what a given slot actually holds.

## Gotchas

- **A `set` on a *disabled* slot may not apply immediately, and `mqtt status`
  shows the broker's *cached* config, not NVS** — so a slot can look
  mis-configured right after a `set` (#67). Do your `set`s, then
  `mqtt enable <N>` (which reloads), or reboot. If a field looks wrong, re-apply
  it while the slot is enabled.
- **wss/TLS brokers need a valid wall clock** (cert validity, and JWT `exp` where
  used). Until the clock syncs (NTP, or a GPS fix), such a slot reads
  `state=held(no-clock)` in `mqtt status` — that's *deferred, not failing*; it
  connects on its own once the clock is sane. This now includes the OKIMesh
  slots (0, 1), which moved to wss in #592; a plain-`mqtt://` tcp broker (e.g. a
  hand-added LAN Mosquitto) never waits on the clock.

## First-time bring-up (minimal)

```
set wifi.ssid YourSSID
set wifi.pwd  YourPSK
wifi status                       # confirm StaConnected + IP
# ...configure a broker slot (see "Broker auth — wss/jwt" above)...
mqtt status                       # wss reads held(no-clock) until the clock syncs, then up
```

## Broker health & the `Failed` state

`mqtt status` shows a state per broker slot. What each means for you:

| State | What it means |
|---|---|
| `up` | connected and publishing |
| `backoff` | last attempt failed; retrying, with the wait growing the longer it keeps failing (5s → 15s → 30s → 60s → 120s) |
| `held(budget)` | fine — just waiting its turn; only one TLS broker is live at a time and another has the slot |
| `held(no-clock)` | waiting for the clock to sync (NTP/GPS) before a TLS handshake — **not** a failure |
| `held(no-heap)` | deferred because free memory is low — rare |
| `failed(gave-up)` | **the observer has given up on this broker** — see below |

### When a broker keeps failing

If a broker is unreachable (server down, wrong host, blocked, bad cert), the
observer retries with an **escalating backoff** so a flaky broker can't hog a
connection slot from a healthy one. If it keeps failing through the full
escalation, the observer marks it **`failed(gave-up)`**: it stops trying,
**drops out of rotation entirely**, and frees its memory. This is deliberate —
a permanently-dead broker should not burn a rotation turn every cycle or waste
heap. Your other brokers are unaffected.

### Clearing a `failed` broker

`failed(gave-up)` is terminal — the observer will **not** retry it on its own.
To bring it back after you've fixed the underlying problem (server back up, host
corrected, etc.), **reconfigure the slot**, which clears the failure and starts
it fresh:

```
mqtt set <N> url wss://your.broker:443/mqtt   # re-set any field, or
mqtt enable <N>                               # toggle it, or
mqtt disable <N> ; mqtt enable <N>
mqtt status                                   # slot returns to backoff -> up
```

A reboot also clears it (state is not persisted), but reconfiguring the slot is
the intended, no-reboot path.
