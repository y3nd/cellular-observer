scripts/pio-flash.py - LoRa flash-discipline wrapper (Python body)

Reads C:\\Dev\\LoRa\\hardware-devices.yaml, enumerates present USB serial
ports via Windows PowerShell, and gates all device-touching operations on:

  Tier 0  (free)         passive enumeration ('list' subcommand)
  Tier B  (identity-gate) port-opening read-only ('monitor', 'info')
  Tier A  (full gate)    state-changing ('upload', 'read-mac', 'bootstrap')
                          requires preview -> token -> confirm two-stage

Tracks: Strycher/LoRa#47 (A2, sub-task of Epic A #44)
Schema: C:\\Dev\\LoRa\\hardware-devices.yaml (A1 #46)
Hook:   .claude/hooks/block-raw-flash.sh (A3 #48, pending)
Proposal: C:\\Dev\\LoRa\\proposal-flash-discipline.md

Usage:
    pio-flash list
    pio-flash preview  <device> --env <pio-env>
    pio-flash preview  <device> --artifact <path> [--erase]
    pio-flash confirm  <device> --token <token-file>
    pio-flash monitor  <device> [--env <env>] [--baud 115200]
    pio-flash info     <device>
    pio-flash read-mac <device>
    pio-flash backup   <device> [--output <path>] [--size <bytes>]
    pio-flash bootstrap <name> --port <COMx>

Exit codes:
    0  success
    1  error (registry, args, refusal, etc.)
    2  preview-only success (token written, did NOT flash)

    #
    # Everything above requires a port TRANSITION -- `new` is built by
    # subtracting `before_coms`, so a device that keeps its COM port can never
    # produce a candidate, no matter how healthy it is. That assumption holds
    # for bridge-attached boards (the CP2102/CH340 keeps its own port while the
    # SoC behind it reboots) and for nRF52 (app CDC -> separate DFU port).
    #
    # It does NOT hold when the USB device IS the SoC. On ESP32-C3/C6/S3 in
    # USB-Serial/JTAG mode the download-mode peripheral lives in the same
    # silicon: the port does not drop, the PID stays 303A:1001, and the serial
    # is unchanged. Enumeration before and after the trigger is byte-identical,
    # so the loop above spins for the full timeout and refuses a device that is
    # sitting right there. Observed on rcc6-bench-1 (ESP32-C6) and reported on
    # rc32-bench-1 (ESP32-S3) -- both native-USB.
    #
    # IDENTITY IS NOT RELAXED. We fall back ONLY on serial equality, which is
    # the same guarantee the fast path uses: the SoC serial is constant across
    # USB-mode changes, so a port carrying this device's serial IS this device
    # (#503). We deliberately do NOT fall back on vendor+PID -- a class match
    # must never be able to claim the flash target -- and we still refuse on
    # ambiguity rather than pick.
    #
    # WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE. Because enumeration is identical either way, a
    # same-port match cannot confirm the device actually entered download mode.
    # It only says "this is the right device, on this port". esptool performs
    # its own sync on the next step and fails loudly if the ROM loader is not
    # answering, so a failed trigger surfaces there rather than being silently
    # flashed over. Say so out loud instead of implying a verified transition.

    On ESP32-S3 native-USB boards (e.g. XIAO_S3 / RAK_4631 nRF native USB),
    opening the port does not reset the chip.

    On CP2102-bridged ESP32 boards (notably Heltec V3), DTR/RTS are physically
    wired to BOOT/RESET. Default PlatformIO monitor behavior toggles DTR/RTS
    on port open, which resets the chip and -- under tight heap budgets --
    can throw it into a crash-cycle. To prevent that, the affected envs in
    meshcore-firmware (see variants/heltec_v3/platformio.ini
    [env:heltec_v3_companion_observer_wifi]) set:

        monitor_rts = 0
        monitor_dtr = 0

    PlatformIO only picks up those env-scoped settings when monitor is
    invoked with `-e <env>`. Pass --env here to forward that through.
    Without --env on a CP2102 board, monitor open WILL reset the chip;
    a stderr warning is emitted so the operator sees this before the device
    cycles.

    Tracking: Strycher/LoRa#302 (this fix). Prior art comment lives in the
